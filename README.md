Rhythm Rumble is a rhythm game built with Unity. Players play as a dancer in a mysterious underground tournament, and they are challenged in a series of dance-battles to the death. The pressure is on because this is unlike any dance battle you've been a part of. Players must watch out for their health as too many wrong moves will result in their permanent elimination. However, it goes both ways, and players can choose whether to defeat their enemies with style or in blood.
Along the way, players can choose from a variety of upgrades to enhance their dancing (or fighting) skills.

To build the game (if Unity is already installed), you can download this repository and build it on your personal computer. I have included a Mac-compatible version to this submission.

Playing the game:
To begin, players navigate the main menu with the mouse or arrow keys, and then can select the play button to begin the game.
The first level will then start. The base gameplay is similar to Dance Dance Revolution. 
Arrows will fall towards the bottom of the screen and it is up to the players to hit them with correct timing and precision.
Longer combos and more precise inputs will result in more points.
While a player plays, there is a pressure meter that will slowly fill. As the meter gets more full, the size of the area
where notes must be pressed will get smaller, making it more difficult as the level progresses. However, players also earn
more points as the pressure gauge goes up.
Players have two ways of winning a level. They can either finish the level to the end, or deplete their opponent of health.
After each level, players will have the choice of one of three cybernetc upgrades that to enhance their dancing skills.
